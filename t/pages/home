Ever get tired of writing tedius HTML when you just want to slap
some text where people can see it? Enter `WWW::Hashbang` - a small
web application written with [`Dancer`](http://p3rl.org/Dancer)
quickly publishing text webpages.

You write your content in an [expanded](http://p3rl.org/Text::MultiMarkdown)
form of Markdown, a simple markup language, and `WWW::Hashbang` will
turn it into a somewhat nice-looking webpage like this one. Now
publishing is simple and fast, so you can concentrate on doing
what matters, and let `WWW::Hashbang` handle the tedium.

`WWW::Hashbang` was written by Mike Doherty. The latest version is
available on the [CPAN](http://p3rl.org/WWW::Hashbang); you can find
the development version on [github](https://github.com/doherty/WWW-Hashbang).
